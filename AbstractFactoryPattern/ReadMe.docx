The Abstract Factory Design Pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for 
creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

What is the Abstract Factory Pattern?
The Abstract Factory Pattern allows you to create a super-factory that can create other factories. 
This super-factory is also known as a factory of factories. 
The main advantage of using the Abstract Factory Pattern is that it isolates the client code from 
the concrete classes of objects that are created, leading to more decoupled and maintainable code.

Key Points:
Encapsulates a group of individual factories.
Provides a way to create related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
Promotes consistency among products created by the factories.
Real-World Example:

Step-by-Step Implementation
Define abstract product interfaces.
Create concrete product classes.
Define the abstract factory interface.
Implement concrete factory classes.
Use the abstract factory in client code.

Tips and Best Practices

Consistency: Ensure that products created by the factories are consistent and related.
Extendability: Abstract Factory makes it easy to introduce new product families without 
changing existing code.

Decoupling: The pattern decouples client code from the concrete classes of products, 
making it easier to maintain and extend.

Avoid Overuse: Use the Abstract Factory Pattern when you have multiple families of products.
Overusing it can lead to unnecessary complexity.

Conclusion
The Abstract Factory Pattern is a powerful tool for creating families of related objects 
without specifying their concrete classes. It promotes consistency among products and decouples 
client code from concrete implementations, making your codebase more maintainable and scalable. 
By following the steps outlined in this blog, you can easily implement the Abstract Factory Pattern 
in your own C# applications.
